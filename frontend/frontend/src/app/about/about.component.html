            This project explores the concept of an environmentally conscious delivery service. The goal is to reduce
            the
            ecological impact of last-mile logistics by prioritizing sustainable transportation methods, efficient route
            planning, and responsible resource use. By combining technology with environmental awareness, the project
            aims to
            demonstrate how delivery services can be both practical and climate-friendly.
